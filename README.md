# Music-Therapy
I'm currently developing a project that explores the impact of various music genres on mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and correlation analysis. I am applying techniques such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and regression analysis to uncover relationships between listening habits and mental health outcomes. The goal is to identify actionable insights for designing personalized music therapy recommendations to improve mental well-being.
