# Music Therapy & Mental Wellness: A Data-Driven Personalized Recommendation System

---

## Project Motivation
Music is a powerful emotional tool, often used for stress relief, mood regulation, and mental support.  
This project explores how **data science** and **machine learning** can personalize music recommendations based on **mental health profiles** and **listening behaviors**, aiming to **enhance emotional wellness through tailored musical experiences**.

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Loading and Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Listener Segmentation**
4. **Music Impact Prediction**
5. **Recommendation System Development**
6. **Real-Time Track Fetching**
7. **Web Application**

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Machine Learning**: Classification, Clustering, Cosine Similarity
- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML, CSS (Spotify-styled UI)
- **Spotify API**: Real-time genre-to-track mapping
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Interactive Deployment**: Flask + Webbrowser (inside Notebook)
